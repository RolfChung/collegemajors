In this project plots are created using pyplot and matplotlib directly. When we want to explore a new dataset by quickly creating visualizations, using these tools directly can be cumbersome. Thankfully, pandas has many methods for quickly generating common plots from data in DataFrames. Like pyplot, the plotting functionality in pandas is a wrapper for matplotlib. This means we can customize the plots when necessary by accessing the underlying Figure, Axes, and other matplotlib objects.

The explored data set is that of job outcomes of students who graduated from college between 2010 and 2012. The original data on job outcomes was released by American Community Survey, which conducts surveys and aggregates the data. FiveThirtyEight cleaned the dataset and released it on their Github repo.

Each row in the dataset represents a different major in college and contains information on gender diversity, employment rates, median salaries, and more.
